Not sure if this is relevant but I am in my early 20s.\n\nLike the title says, I would like to learn software engineering to make apps that I would like to use. For example, I use a couple of subscription on my phone and am getting tired of paying every month just to use the app or there is a specific feature that I would like that many other people might not want so it doesn’t make sense for the creators to make the feature. Plus I think it would be a good skill to have.\n\nIs it possible for me to learn enough to be able to make apps (don’t particularly care about how it looks at the beginning more so just the function, but down the line would like to have it look neat and nice) and also I know Python can be used for backend stuff, can it also be used for frontend or would I need to learn syntax of a different language.\n\nThanks for the help in advance.\n\nNote: I am not looking to become a software engineer at the moment, maybe if I enjoy the app creation I might think about that in the future but my current job is quite easy and pays decent.",

I've never been a programming genius, but I genuinely enjoy what I do—well, at least until I hit certain types of problems.\n\nWhat frustrates me is that I often get stuck on issues that others around me (sometimes with similar experience levels) seem to solve quickly, even if they're complex. When it's someone with many years of experience, I get it—but it's not always the case.\n\nI notice that I’m especially slow when dealing with new technologies. I sometimes feel like my colleagues judge me for this. Maybe they underestimate the work involved, or maybe it really is easier for them. Either way, I can’t help but wonder if they're right to think I’m just... slow.\n\nWhat hits me hardest is that after spending days stuck on something, once I finally figure it out, I look back and think: “That really shouldn't have taken me so long.” Of course things seem easier in hindsight, but I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I am the problem and should be improving faster.\n\nI’d love to hear from other software engineers: did you go through this too? Does it get better? Do you have any tips?\nI still enjoy coding, but these moments really make me question if I'm cut out for this.",
